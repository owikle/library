## About Runakunaq Bibliotecanku

Runakunaq Bibliotecanku is in early stages of development! If you would like to report a bug, suggest a new resource, or contribute in any way, please contact [Alía (aliawarsco@nyu.edu)](mailto:aliawarsco@nyu.edu).

Runakunaq Bibliotecanku (The People's Library) was created in 2023 using materials from New York University's [Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies](https://as.nyu.edu/research-centers/clacs.html) Quechua program. The project is created and maintained by [Alía Warsco](aliawars.co), and is further supported by the [Runasimi Outreach Committe](https://www.instagram.com/roc_nyu/?hl=en).

This online library and archive preserves and provides access to books from a variety of topics, including Andean History and Worldwide Indigenous Studies, as well as poetry, magazines, and photography books. Additionally, we provide a variety of language learning resources to assist any Quechua-language learners in reaching their goals. 

While scans of some materials are available upon request, we are hoping to work with authors and copyright holders to operate under Indigenous Data Sovergneity guidelines to ensure protection for authors and their work.
